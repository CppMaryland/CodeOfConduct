CppMaryland is a C++ user group intended for learning, networking, and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the C++ community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect and courtesy to each other.

To make clear what is expected, all members, speakers, organizers, and volunteers at any CppMaryland event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

The Short Version
-----------------

CppMaryland is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for CppMaryland.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meeting the sole discretion of the meeting organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the meeting organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meeting.
